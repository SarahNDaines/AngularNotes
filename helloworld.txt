in app.js we create modules

modules are the different components of the Angular App

added ng-app to body tag in index.html
ng-app is called a directive
- tells the scope of the module

in MainController.js we created a new controller
- controller manages the app data
- used property title to store a string
- attach it to $scope

in index.html added ng-controller
- directive to define scope of controller
- properties attached to $scope are avaible here

Used expression to access title from scope
- used to display values on the screen
